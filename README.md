# Case-Study-in-Data-Cleaning-and-Provenance
## CS 513 â€“ FINAL PROJECT
**TEAM 169 - CHIRANJEEVI (CHIRU) KOILOTH, CHUN CHIEH (WILLY) CHANG, AARON BARRIE**

The group project aimed to perform a comprehensive data cleaning study by leveraging various tools and techniques covered during the course. The primary tools utilized included OpenRefine, SQLite, and YesWorkflow.

The project's focus was on improving data quality, particularly when dealing with aggregate data calculations between different data entities, aligned with the U1 Main Use Case. Both the OpenRefine and SQLite processes played critical roles in successfully accomplishing the project's goals.

Although the team faced some challenges with SQLite conventions, like frequent use of UPSERT operations, these conventions were necessary to achieve high-speed execution of SQLite-based operations. While other SQL platforms with UPDATE operations and JOIN conditions might have offered more concise expressions, the chosen UPSERT approach allowed the team to implement a rapid and efficient SQL-based cleanup process.

Overall, the project showcases the team's proficiency in using a variety of data cleaning tools and demonstrates their ability to enhance data quality in support of a significant use case.
